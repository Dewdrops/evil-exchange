  ;; This function does the real exchange work. Here's the detailed steps:
  ;; 1. call extract-fn with orig-beg and orig-end to extract orig-text.
  ;; 2. call extract-fn with curr-beg and curr-end to extract curr-text.
  ;; 3. go to orig-beg and then call insert-fn with curr-text.
  ;; 4. go to curr-beg and then call insert-fn with orig-text.
  ;; After step 2, the two markers of the same beg/end pair (curr or orig)
  ;; will point to the same position. So if orig-beg points to the same position
  ;; of curr-end initially, orig-beg and curr-beg will point to the same position
  ;; before step 3. Because curr-beg is a marker which moves after insertion, the
  ;; insertion in step 3 will push it to the end of the newly inserted text,
  ;; thus resulting incorrect behaviour.
  ;; To fix this edge case, we swap two extracted texts before step 3 to
  ;; effectively reverse the (problematic) order of two `evil-exchange' calls.
